    "    - look for sentences (which have verbs) and as opposed to lists of nouns. For example, [`nltk` does part of speech tagging](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html) but it is a little slow. There may also be heuristics that accomplish the same thing.\n",
    "    - Similarly, spaCy's [entity recognition](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/entity-recognition) could be useful here.\n",
    "    - Look for commonly repeated threads (e.g. you might end up picking up the photo credits or people such as \"a friend\").\n",
    "    - Long captions are often not lists of people.  The cutoff is subjective, but for grading purposes, *set that cutoff at 250 characters*.\n",
    "  2. You will want to separate the captions based on various forms of punctuation.  Try using `re.split`, which is more sophisticated than `string.split`. **Note**: Use regex exclusively for name parsing.\n",
    "  3. This site is pretty formal and likes to say things like \"Mayor Michael Bloomberg\" after his election but \"Michael Bloomberg\" before his election.  Can you find other titles that are being used?  They should probably be filtered out because they ultimately refer to the same person: \"Michael Bloomberg.\"\n",
    "  4. There is a special case you might find where couples are written as eg. \"John and Mary Smith\". You will need to write some extra logic to make sure this properly parses to two names: \"John Smith\" and \"Mary Smith\".\n",
    "  5. When parsing names from captions, it can help to look at your output frequently and address the problems that you see coming up, iterating until you have a list that looks reasonable. Because we can only asymptotically approach perfect identification and entity matching, we have to stop somewhere.\n",
