Pumpkins carved in the likeness of Dennis,Randi Riese,honorees at Citymeals-on-Wheels 26th Annual “Power Lunch for Women.
Paula Zahn,one of the honorees of this year’s Power Lunch,has been involved with Citymeals-on-Wheels for over 20 years. To the assembled crowd,she told the moving story of a homebound senior she visited – a 95-year-old former nurse who is afflicted,glaucoma loss,hearing loss,who has outlived her friends,family,whose only human contact is through the meal-delivery service. The former news anchor also pointed out that Citymeals’ beneficiaries often live only a block or two from our own comfortable apartments.
Pumpkin carved in the likeness of Paula Zahn.
Gael Greene,restaurant critic,author,co-founded Citymeals-on-Wheels in 1981with James Beard after she read an article in The New York Times about homebound elderly in New York who had nothing to eat on holidays,weekends. The writer of that article,Dorothy Gaiter,also received special recognition at this year’s Power Lunch. To date,Citymeals has delivered 46 million free meals to shut-in seniors.

Philanthropic husband,wife duo,Dennis Riese,Randi Riese,honorees at this year’s Power Lunch,have provided 500,000 meals by Gael Greene’s estimate,through their long,generous support of Citymeals.

Scooter,Cat of the Year. Scooter now visits a nursing home,rehabilitation hospital every week,serves as a constant inspiration to the elderly,to patients who lack mobility due to injuries,strokes. During one of Scooter’s first hospital visits,a stroke victim who s said would never open her eyes or speak watched as the cat snuggled up close to her. It was then that Scooter had worked his first miracle: the patient opened her eyes,began chatting away like they were old friends.

Another really lovely unforgettable first-class experience being handled by professionals.
